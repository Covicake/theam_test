##Getting started:

All you need to do to run the server is install the dependencies with: npm install and then start the server with npm run start.

The database information is stored in 'ormconfig.json' at the projects root, I didn't upload that file, but you can build your own [following this instructions](http://typeorm.io/#/using-ormconfig/)
